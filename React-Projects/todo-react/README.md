##### A simple to-do list in React.js backed by a Node.js REST API

This is a learning exercise in Node and React for me. The app is a simple to-do list.
I used Express to expose a REST API for CRUD operations on list items,
and in React created a simple interface for interacting with the list.
Items are stored in MongoDB.
